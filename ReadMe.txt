This package contains our implementation for:
"Saliency Detection for Strip Steel Surface Defects using Multiple Constraints and Improved Texture Features"
=====================================================================================
*** The code is run on Matlab 2018a on Windows 10/64 bit
*** Lower version of Matlab may cause several errors

Usage:
>> put the test images into file '\Image'
>> run 'demo_MCITF.m'
>> the output saliency maps are stored in the file '\OUT'

=====================================================================================
Note: 
1. The file 'Results' contains the experimental results of all the methods presented in our paper.
2. The file 'SD-saliency-900' contains the source images of strip steel and the corresponding the pixel-wise binary maps (ground truth).
