# MCITF
source code for our paper [Saliency detection for strip steel surface defects using multiple constraints and improved texture features](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0143816619317361) by Guorong Song, Kechen Song and Yunhui Yan.

**The code is run on Matlab 2018a on Windows 10/64 bit**

**Lower version of Matlab may cause several errors**

Usage:
1. put the test images into file '\Image'
2. run 'demo_MCITF.m'
3. the output saliency maps are stored in the file '\OUT'

---
Note: 
1. The file 'Results' contains the experimental results of all the methods presented in our paper.
2. The file 'SD-saliency-900' contains the source images of strip steel and the corresponding the pixel-wise binary maps (ground truth).
